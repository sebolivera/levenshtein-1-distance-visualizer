## Who

Me.

## What

[Levenshtein 1-Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) Visualizer is a simple app showing the immediate neighbors of any word present in the english dictionary.

Currently it only displays immediate neighbors for a given word, but I plan on creating a "true" graph visualizer at some point.

Made with Go so that I could get used to it.

### Why

![Uhhhh...](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/859/202/790.png)

Excellent question.

## Setup

- Install [Go v1.20](https://go.dev/) and the latest version of [nodejs/npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (if you haven't already).
- Run `npm run install-go-dep`(or `cd api` and then `go get ./...`) to install the API's dependencies.
- Run `npm i` to install the front-end dependencies.

## Launching the app (dev)

- Run `npm run dev` to start up the react app.
- Run `npm run backend-dev` (or `cd api` followed by `go run api.go`).


## Known issues

These are basically just duplicates of the Issues tab, but this isn't a real project. So here's all of the stuff I'm aware of, and what I will (probably) do about it.

|Issue Name |Detail |Status |
---|:---|:---
|Clunky Backend|The Go "backend" is clunky and needs heavy refactoring|`Will work on it soonâ„¢`|
|Go packages misuse|Go package structure isn't made for what I did, I know. I just ordered it that way so that it would be familiar visual while I learn the language.|`Might fix it`|
|Use of insertion sort|Returned list is sorted using insertion sort instead of more "performant" sorting algorithms.|`Won't change it` It works well enough for the supplied samples.|
|Data management|Data is currently cached by Go and only supports the english dictionary in the english_dictionary.txt file.|`Unknown`|
|React Spaghetti|The React front-end is a mess | `I know`|
|Data Improvement|Add definitions/synonyms, or even source the data from a live dictionary API?|`Maybe`|
|Backend performance|The algorithm that grabs the neighbors for a given word is not optimized at all.|`Will fix, when the rest of the app is done.`|
|Bad implementation of the node distribution|The nodes are generated in front-end JS, which is immensly unpotimised.|`Will fix it sometime in the future`|
